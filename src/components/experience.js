                After finishing high school I got my first job in a local food

                clear the space, watch stocks etc... all the Waiter/Bartender
                responsibilities. As it was my first job ever I learnt a lot

                  Later I got a chance to work in a night club as a Head
                  Bartender, where I got even more responsibilities, besides all
                  the Waiter/Bartender stuff I got to organise events, shifts,
